# unicef_app

A new Flutter project.

## Creating a new feature branch

First check out the main branch:

      git checkout main

then pull recent changes:

      git pull

Then create your new branch as follows:

      git checkout -b "[your-name]/[name-that-describes-feature]"

(ex: "kayla/homepage-indicators")

You can now make commits. The first time you push after creating a new branch, you'll have to run the following command:

      git push --set-upstream origin "[SAME NAME AS ABOVE]"

This creates a remote branch (visible to everyone on github) that matches your local branch. When you are ready to merge your code into main, create a pull request here. Mia and Isaac will then look over and approve your changes.
